```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


In this lab you can use the interactive console to explore or **Knit** the document. 
Remember anything you type here can be "sent" to the console with Cmd-Enter (OS-X) or Cntr-Enter (Windows/Linux) in an R code chunk.


# Part 1

1. create a new variable called `my.num` that contains 6 numbers
```{r}

```

2. mulitply `my.num` by 4
```{r}

```


3. create a second variable called `my.char` that contains 5 character strings
```{r}

```


4. combine the two variables `my.num` and `my.char` into a variable called `both`
```{r}

```

5. what is the length of `both`?
```{r}

```


6. what class is `both`?
```{r}

```


# Part 2

7. Divide `both` by 3, what happens?
```{r, error=TRUE}

```

8. create a vector with elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 and call it `x`
```{r}

```


9. create another vector with elements 10 20 30 40 50 and call it `y`
```{r}

```


10. what happens if you try to add x and y together? why?
```{r}

```



11. append the value 60 onto the vector `y` (hint: you can use the `c()` function)
```{r}

```

12. add `x` and `y` together
```{r}

```


13. multiply `x` and `y` together. pay attention to how R performs operations on vectors of the same length.
```{r}

```
