## Notice the theme!

- My slides are written using markdown (...sort of)
- So the markdown output you see here matches the slides theme
- I'll talk about modifying themes later

# What does this have to do with open science?

Using Markdown to generate publications, reports, websites, etc. will:
* Make dynamically updating them with new results easier
* Reduce errors from manually entering results 
* Create new venues for science communication

Using Markdown to organize your code will:
* Allow you to organize and annotate your analyses 
* Make it easier for others to tell what you did, aiding reproducibility

## An overview

- Anything inside dollar signs `$` is treated as "inline" maths
- Anything inside two dollar `$$` is a standalone equation
- Whitespace matters: `$x$` is an equation, `$x $` is not
- Equations follow "LaTeX" rules

This equation is standalone

# Visual Editor

-One fairly new feature (and one reason we're using RStudio today!) is their new [visual markdown editor](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/). It's basically an ultra powerful hybrid of Markdown and Microsoft Word. But be warned, it's a little buggy if you frequently switch editing modes. 

-People write whole books in Markdown, and this may make that seem a little more achievable. For example, the new visual editor allows [easy citation management with a Zotero library](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/rstudio-1-4-preview-citations/) (if we have time, I'll show you this on my computer).

# Cheat Sheet

# The Future

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a sequel to RMarkdown developed by RStudio. 

- While they are still maintaining RMarkdown, a lot of new development will probably happen in Quarto.

- The differences between RMarkdown and Quarto are not huge for R users ([overview here](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)), and there is much more RMarkdown documentation available, which is why I taught it today. 

I encourage you to keep tabs on Quarto's development and try it out, especially if you're not an R user.
