There will be 10 DCAs over the course of the semester that will involve analyzing a set
of data and interpreting the findings. For each DCA, I will post a scenario describing a
research project accompanied by a fictional dataset. Your task is to analyze the data and
to write a “Results & Discussion” report in RMD. You may work together and/or
consult one another when analyzing the data but you must work alone when writing the
report
