Research methodology/design, measurement, statistical analysis, and statistical computing are
vast areas, each with their own texts, literature, advances, and sub-disciplines within psychology.
Exhaustive coverage of any one of these topics is beyond the scope of a semester-long course.
Rather, my goal is to provide you with a solid introduction to these topics and to develop an
understanding of how integration of these areas is vital to conducting scientific research. My hope
is that this course prepares you to pursue further coursework and independent study in each of
these quantitative areas.
