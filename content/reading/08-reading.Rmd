#  Linear Modeling

I think both these books have excellent chapters on linear modeling/regression. I encourage you to read them. 

[Gelman et al. Regression and Other Stories Chapters 6, 7, 8, 10 ](/readings_pdf/Regression and Other Stories by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, Aki Vehtari.pdf)

[Imai and Williams Chapter 4](/readings_pdf/Quantitative Social Science An Introduction by Kosuke Imai.pdf)


Recommended: 

Excellent chapter

[Nick Huntington-Klein - The Effect Chapter 13- Regression ]([https://theeffectbook.net/ch-StatisticalAdjustment.html)

[Quantitude - Regression like that old friend you've outgrown](https://quantitudepod.org/s2e18-regression-like-that-old-high-school-friend-youve-outgrown/)
