#  Linear Modeling

I think both these books have excellent chapters on linear modeling/regression. I encourage you to read them. 

[Gelman et al. Regression and Other Stories Chapters 6, 7, 8, 10 ](/readings_pdf/Regression and Other Stories by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, Aki Vehtari.pdf)

[Imai and Williams Chapter 4](/readings_pdf/Quantitative Social Science An Introduction by Kosuke Imai.pdf)
