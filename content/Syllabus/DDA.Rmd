There will roughly 10 problem sets over the course of the semester that will involve applying what you learned in class and practicing your R skills and analyzing a set of data and interpreting the findings. For each DCA, I will post a scenario describing a
research project accompanied by a fictional data set. Your task is to analyze the data and to write a “Results & Discussion” report in RMD. You may work together and/or
consult one another when analyzing the data but you must work alone when writing the
report
