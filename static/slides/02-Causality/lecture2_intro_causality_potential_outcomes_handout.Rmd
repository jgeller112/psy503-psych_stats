# The Rubin Causal Model: A Powerful Framework to Study Causal Effects and Threats to Causal Inference

---
# Rubin Causal Model

- Framework developed by Donald Rubin (Rubin, 1974, 1975)   

- Mathematical definition of causal effects at the individual level 

- Establishes the impossibility of measuring causal effects for an individual 


.footnote[[1].Other Theories: Judea Pearl's **The Book of Why**]


---
# What is Causality (Formally)? 

- Notion of causality is tied to an __action__ applied to a __unit__

--

- In Psychology: 

  - __Unit__: Target of study (__individual__ , __classrooms__)
  
      - **i**  
  
  - __Treatment__: Intervention received by one group of units but not the other
  
      - **d** or **z** 
  
  - __Response__: Outcome of study
  
      - **Y** 

---
What is Causality (Formally)? 

- Let $d_i$ be a treatment (e.g., testing)  

- Let $Y_i$ be an outcome (e.g., performance on  test)  

<br>
<br>

> A treatment $d_i$ has a causal effect on an outcome $Y_i$   for individual $i$ (e.g., student) if the action of $d_i$ on  individual $i$ impacts $Y_i$ (i.e., the extent to which a student using quizzing affects performance)

---
# Core Concept: Potential Outcomes (Counterfactuals) 

- Each individual has different __potential outcomes__ in alternative environments 

- To measure the causal effect of a treatment $d_i$ for individual $i$:  

  - Measure the outcome of interest $Y_i$ for individual $i$ in two environments $E_0$ and $E_1$ that differ on one aspect: $d_i$  
--

- Example: 

  - Does the minimum wage increase with the unemployment rate?
    
      - Unemployment rate went up after the minimum wage increased
        
      - Would the unemployment rate have gone up, had the minimum wage increase not occurred?

---
# Potential Outcomes Notation

- $E_0$: $d_i = 0$, treatment was not applied to individual $i$        

- $E_1$: $d_i = 1$, treatment was applied to individual $i$ 

- Imagine we can observe both $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ for the exact same individual $i$ in $E_0$ and $E_1$, respectively.  

- For individual $i$, the causal effect $\tau_i$ of the treatment $d_i$ is defined as the difference between two potential outcomes:   

\begin{equation}    
\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)   
\end{equation}  

---
# Implications 

- If $\tau_i = 0$, using testing has no causal effect on $Y_i$  

- If $\tau_i \neq 0$, testing has a causal effect on $Y_i$  

- The _magnitude_ of the causal effect for individual $i$ is $\tau_i$, such that $$\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$

# ATE: Formal Defintion  

\begin{equation} 
  \mathrm{ATE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \tau_i
\end{equation} 

- Population ATE is defined as the sum of $\tau_i$ divided by N, the number of individuals $i$ the population  

- Describes how the outcome of interest $Y_i$ would change on average in the population if the treatment was applied to every single individual in the population. 

- It is an extremely important concept in psychology   

  - Identify and quantify average effects of treatments in populations  
---
# Problems? 

<br>

<br>

- $\tau_i$ is forever unknown    

- We generally don't have access to the entire population of interest  

- How do we __estimate__ population average treatment effects?

# Experimental Design
---
# Experimental Design

- What is an experiment?

  > __Experiment__: Any study conducted under controlled conditions to measure the impact of a novel treatment or other manipulation

  > __Randomized experiment__: Chance process determines assignment of units to treatment conditions (e.g., coin flip, random number generator)


---
# Random?

<br>
<br>

- Every person (or unit) has some chance (i.e., a non-zero probability) of being selected into the treatment or control group

- The selection is based upon a random process (e.g., names out of a hat, a random number generator, rolls of dice, etc.)
---
# Experimental Design

-  Why randomized experiments? 

    - Random assignment ensures that outcomes of the untreated (control) group are an appropriate counterfactual for the treated (experimental) group
    
    - Randomization ensures groups are identical (on average) and thus there is no selection bias in the estimate of the ATE
    
    - Balances all observed variables as well as unobserved variables

---
# Experimental Design

- Helps us: 

    - Identify the presence of causal effects  
  
        - Does a causal effect exist at all? 
  
  - Statistical significance 

      - Estimate the magnitude of causal effects   
      - What is the direction of the causal effect? 

  - Practical significance  
  
      - Is the causal effect relevant?

# Potential and Observed Outcomes : Switching Equation

- Causal inference is a missing data problem! 

- Observed outcome $Y_i$ -> Underlying potential outcomes

\begin{equation} 
  Y_i = Y_i(1)z_i + Y_i(0)(1-z_i)
\end{equation} 

- Treatment Applied: $$Y_i = 1 * Y^1_i  + 0 * Y^0_i$$
  $$Y_i = Y^1_i$$
- Treatment Not Applied: $$Y_i = 0 * Y1_i + 0 * Y_i0$$
  $$Y_i = Y^0_i$$

???
The switching equation works a lot like Schrodinger‚Äôs cat paradox. Schrodinger‚Äôs cat is placed in a sealed box and receives a dose of poison when an atom emits a radiation. As long as the box is sealed, there is no way we can know whether the cat is dead or alive. When we open the box, we observe either a dead cat or a living cat, but we cannot observe the cat both alive and dead at the same time. The switching equation is like opening the box, it collapses the observed outcome into one of the two potential ones.

# Urn Example

# Estimation of the ATE: Samples

First, let's work in previous equation to express the ATE with regards to $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$: 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
\mathrm{ATE} &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\tau_i} \\
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{(Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0))} \\
&= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{Y_{i}(1)} - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{Y_{i}(0)} \\
&= \mu_{Y(1)} - \mu_{Y(0)}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

in which $\mu_{Y(1)}$ is the average value of $Y_i(1)$ for all individuals and $\mu_{Y(0)}$ is the average value of $Y(0)$ for all subjects.
---
# Estimation of the ATE in Experiments   

In experimental studies, researchers estimate $\mu_{Y_i(1)}$ using the mean $\widehat{\mu}_{Y(1)}$ of all observed $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ using the mean $\widehat{\mu}_{Y(0)}$ of observed $Y_i(0)$. We have:  

\begin{equation}
\widehat{\mathrm{ATE}} = \widehat{\mu}_{Y(1)} - \widehat{\mu}_{Y(0)}
\end{equation}

in which $\widehat{\mathrm{ATE}}$ is the estimated ATE, $\widehat{\mu}_{Y(1)}$ is the estimated $\mu_{Y(1)}$, and $\widehat{\mu}_{Y(0)}$ is the estimated $\mu_{Y(0)}$.
