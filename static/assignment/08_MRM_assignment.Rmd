# Problem Set 8: Categorical by Cateogorical Interactions

A student brought up an interesting issue. The motivation variable (while it is labeled numerical/continuous) takes only certain values. For this assignment use the same data, but I want you to re-run the analysis by categorizing the motivation variable (into 4 levels) and run a 2 X 4 ANOVA on the data. 

Please test the appropriate assumptions and interpret the findings. Please include an ANOVA table (use the `nice` function in `afex` or knitr::kable) and a figure.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# get the data
install.packages("candisc")
load(HSB)
```
